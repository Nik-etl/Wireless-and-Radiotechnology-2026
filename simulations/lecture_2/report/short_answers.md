What is the difference between time domain and frequency domain?

- Time domain plots the amplitude with respect to time, and frequency domain takes the amplitudes and plots them against frequencies usually resulting in a spiked appearance.

Why does filtering help in RF receivers?

- Filtering is a way to minimize noise in RF signals, but more importantly it allows for tuning in for specific bands

What does modulation achieve in an RF system?

- Modulation turns low frequency information onto a high frequency carrier wave. This is important because lower frequencies require larger antennas, therefore a higher frequency signal allows for a practical antenna.

From A2: which filter was easiest to design and why?

- The Low pass and high pass filters were the easiest to design because they simply requires a cut off frequency.

From A3: where do the new frequency components appear after modulation?

- The low-frequency message signal is being multiplied by a high-frequency carrier. This process shifts the message's energy away from 0 Hz and places it into two sidebands centered around the carrier frequency, allowing for efficient wireless transmission
