# MATLAB Thermal Noise Generation

## Objective
To simulate and analyze thermal noise using MATLAB, and visualize its characteristics.


## Evaluations
1. **Time Domain**: the noise amplitude fluctuates randomly around zero. 
2. **PSD Analysis**: In the simulation, the PSD shows fuzziness or variance. This is due to the finite sample size

## Experimentation
1. **Temperature**: Increasing T increases the noise floor.
2. **Resistance**: Higher resistance increases the noise voltage.
3. **Bandwidth**: Wider bandwidth captures more total noise power, though the PSD remains the same.
