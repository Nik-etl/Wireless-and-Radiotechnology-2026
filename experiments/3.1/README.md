Analysis
1. Signal Strength vs. Data Speed Observation: Moving from the Bedroom (-106 dBm) to the Window (-89 dBm) improved the signal strength by 17 dB. However, the download speed remained constant at around 20-22 Mbps.Conclusion: Stronger signal does not always guarantee faster data speeds. The connection could have been limited by the network's bandwidth (10 MHz).

3. The Impact of Obstructions Observation: Moving deep indoors (Bathroom/Bedroom) resulted in a sharp drop in signal strength compared to the Window location. Conclusion: The building's structure caused a signal attenuation of approximately 15-17 dB. This confirms that physical obstructions such as walls and doors can significantly reduce cellular signals, particularly on higher frequencies like Band 7.

4. Signal Quality vs. Stability Observation: The Bathroom location showed weak signal strength (-104 dBm) but high Signal Quality (SINR 13.9 dB). Conclusion: A high SINR indicates low interference from other signals. This allowed the connection to remain stable and maintain usable speeds despite the low signal power.

5. ConclusionsSignal Strength does not equal Speed: High RSRP does not automatically result in higher throughput if the channel width is narrow or the network is loaded.Environment: Residential walls block high-frequency LTE signals, causing measurable drops in power. Reliability: Network stability is heavily dependent on Signal Quality.
