1. **Overview**
The task is to evaluate a wireless link, ny modifying key design parrameters and observe changes in coverage, received power, fresnel clearance, and feasiblity

2. **Increasing Gateway Height to 5m**
- LOS distance increased 1.9km- The link feasibility INC
- The link feasibility is improved because it increases clearance for the fresnel zone as well as the curvature of the earth 

3. **Increase Antenna Gain to 5 dBi**
- The received power curve is raised almost 6 dB
- The effective range is increased approx. 8km
- Higher gain leads to further range as it allows more distance to pass before the transmission power crosses the ensitivity threshold

4. **Change Environment Exponent**
- Increasing n decreases coverage signifigantly (n=3.5 coverage drops 8km)
- Increase in environmental variable effects range more than increase in gain. This is because n effects the exponential decay of the received power, while increase in gain only provides a fixed linear lift. Simply, Gain adds a constant value to the link budget while the environmental variable changes the multiplier of the power curve. 

5. **Move Gateway Location**
- The Fresnel radius is largest at the midpoint of of the transmission distance. This is important because if obstacles cover over the minimum clearance (60% ), the signal link can be ruined.
